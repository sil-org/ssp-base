The sildisco module includes a few Auth Procs that can be called from the `config.php` file or **SP or IdP metadata**.

### AttributeMap.php

Copies (rather than replaces) attributes according to an attribute map.

### TagGroup.php

Grabs the values of the `urn:oid:2.5.4.31` (member of) attribute and prepends them with `idp|<the_idp's_name>|`.
The idp's name value is taken from the saml20-idp-remote.php file.  In particular, if the IdP's metadata entry includes a `'IDPNamespace'` value, that is used. Otherwise, if it includes a `'name'` value, that is used. Otherwise, it uses the entity id of the IdP.

### AddIdp2NameId.php

Grabs the value of the saml:sp:NameID and appends `@<IDPNamespace>` to it.
The IdP's metadata needs to include an `'IDPNamespace'` entry with a string value that is alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores.

In order for this to work, the SP needs to include a line in its authsources.php file in the Hub's entry ...

` 'NameIDPolicy' => "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent",`

In addition, the IDP's sp-remote metadata stanza for the Hub needs to include ...

` 'NameIDFormat' => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent',`

### TrackIdps.php

Creates and/or appends to a session value ("sildisco:authentication", "authenticated_idps") the **entity id** of the latest **IdP** to be used for authentication.

### LogUser.php

Logs information (common name, eduPrincipalPersonalName, employee number, IdP, SP, time) about each successful login to an AWS Dynamodb table.
```
            97 => [
                'class' =>'sildisco:LogUser',
                'DynamoRegion' => 'us-east-1',
                'DynamoLogTable' => 'sildisco_prod_user-log',
            ],
```
The following config is not needed on AWS, but it is needed locally
'DynamoEndpoint' ex. http://dynamo:8000
