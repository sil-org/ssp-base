The sildisco module is a module for simplesamlphp.  It's main purpose is to allow a simplesamlphp hub to control which Service Providers (SP's) can see and authenticate through which Identity Providers (IdP's).

It relies on some utilities found in [ssp-utilities](https://github.com/sil-org/ssp-utilities).
